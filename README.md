# AdharshsFinalApp
 
My app basically allows for users to choose a specific country and view data related to climate change. More specifically, they can view data on average temperatures (in degrees Celsius) for a specific time period for a country as well as average precipitation for those countries too. They can even view a chart representation for all monthly data for precipitation and climate.

How to run the app: use the powershell (use the mongo command line in order for the app to fully work)

How to use the mongo command line:
``` powershell
./mongod --dbpath C:\Users\adhar\data

```
