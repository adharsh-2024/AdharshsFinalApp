# AdharshsFinalApp

My app basically allows for users to choose a specific country and view data related to climate change. More specifically, they can view data on average temperatures (in degrees Celsius) for a specific time period for a country as well as average precipitation for those countries too. They can even view a chart representation for all monthly data for precipitation and climate.

How to run the app: use the powershell (use the mongo command line in order for the app to fully work)

How to use the mongo command line:

./mongod --dbpath C:\Users\adhar\data
To access this app, click on the code button, and click on open with GitHub Desktop. You must have github desktop installed in order for this to work. Once you open the github desktop app, where it says local path for the clone of the repository you want to access, make sure you have your own username as well as Desktop which is the path that the clone will be uploaded to. Also, make sure you have a copy of auth.js somewhere in your files. Make sure you put that in the config folder for this app. Now when you open the Powershell, you'll need to make sure that you have already used the mongo command line. Once you've taken care of that, then do cd Desktop, then ls, and it will show all the files in the Desktop. Do cd AdharshsFinalApp, and then do ls. Make sure to do npm install, and then do npm start. Remember, if you have auth.js, this app should work just fine.
